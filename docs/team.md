# How to add a new team member?

In the root of the project run the following command:

```bash
hugo new team/<name-surname>.md
```

Replace `<name-surname>` with the name and surname of the team member you want to add. Favor lower case names.

This will generate a `<name-surname>.md` file in the `content/team` directory.
The content of the file will look like this:

```
---
name: Candide Smith
organization: IRISA
position: PhD student
category: member 
social:
  website: http://candide.github.io
  twitter: candide-smith
  linkedin: candide-smith
  github: candidesmith
dateOfStay: 
    start: 2023
    end: 
---
```

## Parameters

* `name`: (**Mandatory**) Name of the team member, as it should be displayed.
* `organization`: (**Mandatory**) Current organization to which this team member belongs, for example, Inria.
* `position`: (**Mandatory**) Position the team member holds in the previous organization. Also used to indicate the succesive positions hold in the team.
* `category`: (**Optional**) Possible values are: `permanent`, `member`, `alumni`, `former`. Default value is `member`.
* `social`: Social profiles for the member. All are optional.
* `dateOfStay` : (**Optional**) will help to sort the former members
   * `start` : date of arrival in the lab
   * `end` : date of departure from the team

Team member may add a photo to the website. This photo should be placed in `static/images/team`. The filename should be the same as the Markdown file containing the information about the team member and must be a `PNG` or a `JPEG` image, for example:  `candice-smith.png`. The image may have any size, but favor square dimensions, otherwise the result is unexpected.

If the team member has a Github profile, the build process will fetch its avatar. A default image will be used if there is no Github profile.
