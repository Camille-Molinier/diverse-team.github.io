order: 1

* [Spoon](http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/) parses Java source code and creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Useful for source code instrumentation, automatic refactoring, automatic repair and general source-to-source transformations.

* [Byte Buddy](http://bytebuddy.net/) is a code generation and manipulation library for creating and modifying Java classes during the runtime of a Java application and without the help of a compiler. 

* [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/): Universal virtual machine for running applications written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, JVM-based languages like Java, Scala, Clojure, Kotlin, and LLVM-based languages such as C and C++.

* [Truffle](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle): Language Implementation Framework. Provides a high level representation of the language AST and implements speculative optimizations.

* [Polyglot](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/polyglot/index.html): A language interop framework that allows Truffle languages to call each other

* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. In particular, these are some of the core packages we use the most:
    - NumPy Base N-dimensional array package
    - SciPy library: Fundamental library for scientific computing
    - Matplotlib: Comprehensive 2D Plotting
    - IPython: Enhanced Interactive Console
    - Sympy: Symbolic mathematics
    - pandas:  Data structures & analysis

* [GreyCat: Next-Gen Live Analytics using Temporal Graph](https://github.com/datathings/greycat) GreyCat is the first Temporal Many-World Graph database. In a nutshell, this project defines a graph storage and processing framework that allows you to store and analyze highly interconnected complex data structures and rapidly evolving over time. This data structure can be as well infinitely cloneable in order to evaluate potential alternatives modifications to find the best one. To sum up GreyCat is a core data structure framework to build for businesses, a live reasoning engine that can handle simulations and analytics over data in motion.
