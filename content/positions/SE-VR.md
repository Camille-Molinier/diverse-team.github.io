## Context



Despite the growing industrial interest in virtual reality (VR) applications, the development of such apps is still hand-crafted, leading to high development costs. This is particularly the case for families of VR applications (e.g., vehicle maintenance training with learning) for which engineers develop each application of the same family in an ad-hoc manner despite the many common points from a software engineering (SE) perspective.

SE provides approaches to better manage the development of common functionality applications. In particular, software variability and product lines allow software development to be considered at the level of a family of applications. Adapted to VR, those approaches would significantly reduce development and provide efficient means for software testing.

In a first step of this SE-VR collaboration we had exploited the "business" knowledge concerning the activity of different VR experts to facilitate the design of VR experiments. In a second step, with the aim of generalization, the same approach has been applied to produce in a semi-automatic way: on the GL side, documentation for software modeling languages; on the VR side, an interactive environment.

These previous works, however, did not address the major problems of software variability and product lines in VR applications nor the testing of such applications, which remains a hindrance to the industrialization of this type of applications.

Under these assumptions, the thesis work aims at improving the production of VR applications subject to a significant variability factor. For this, GL techniques (variability management, dynamic product line, dedicated language) will be studied during the design phase. The objective is to produce generic software components common to a family of VR applications. The expected benefits are a factorization and a semi-automation of this production. To validate and debug the development of these components, the developer will have to be able to interact with the virtual environment to iterate this development process.


# Environment

The candidate will work in the DiverSE and the Hybrid research groups, common to CNRS (IRISA) and Inria. The two groupes are located in Rennes. DiverSE research is in the field of software engineering, while Hybrid focuses on VR systems. The main supervisors of the thesis will be Mathieu Acher, Arnaud Blouin and Valérie Gouranton.
