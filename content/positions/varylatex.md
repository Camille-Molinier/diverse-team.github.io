VaryLaTeX is a tool to produce variants of a document written in LaTeX. 
Users simply have to annotate LaTeX source files with some (meta-)information, for example for (de)activating portions of text, tuning figures' sizes, or tweaking line spacing. 
There are several applications, e.g., generating variants of a document that respect imposed constraints, such as formatting instructions and page limits. 
More information can be found here: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01659161 

Currently, the tool is written in Java with a mix of ad-hoc bash scripts and Python/R code. 
We want to fully rewrite VaryLaTeX for improving its usability, performance, and hopefully adoption. 

The goal of the internship is to explore various technological solutions and deliver an integrated and easy-to-use tool.
