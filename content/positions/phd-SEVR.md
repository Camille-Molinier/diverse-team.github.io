# PhD Position "Software engineering and virtual reality: towards better development of VR applications"

## Topic

Despite the growing industrial interest in virtual reality (VR) applications, their development is still carried out in an artisanal manner, leading to high development costs. This is particularly the case for families of VR applications (e.g. vehicle maintenance training with learning) for which engineers develop each of the applications in the same family in an ad-hoc manner despite the many commonalities from a software engineering (SE) perspective.

The GL provides approaches to better manage the development of common functionality applications. In particular, software variability and product lines allow software development to be considered at the level of a family of applications. Adapted to VR, these approaches would significantly reduce development time and provide efficient means of software testing.

In a first step of this GL-RV collaboration (thesis: Towards the automatic generation of Virtual Reality applications), we have exploited the business knowledge about the activity of different VR experts to facilitate the design of VR experiments. In a second step, with the aim of generalisation, the same approach was applied to produce semi-automatically: on the GL side, documentation for software modelling languages; on the VR side, a reactive informed environment.

These previous works, however, did not address the major issues of software variability and product lines in VR applications, nor the testing of these applications, which remains a barrier to the industrialisation of this type of application.

Under these assumptions, the thesis work aims to improve the production of VR applications subject to a high variability factor. For this purpose, GL techniques (variability management, dynamic product line, dedicated language) will be studied during the design phase. The objective is to produce generic software components common to a family of VR applications. The expected benefits are a factorisation and a semi-automation of this production. To validate and debug the development of these components, the developer will need to be able to interact with the virtual environment to iterate this development process.
