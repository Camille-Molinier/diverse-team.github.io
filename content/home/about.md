      <h2>Modeling and Languages Engineering</h2>
      <p>Separation of concerns in the development of complex software-intensive systems leads to the use of various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs). SLE addresses the whole life cycle for designing, implementing and relating DSMLs to support heterogeneous modeling and analysis. </p>

      <h2>DevOps for distributed and heterogeneous system</h2>
      <p>Flexible yet dependable systems have to cope with heterogeneous hardware execution platforms ranging from smart sensors to huge computation infrastructures and data centers. We need to devise formalisms to reason about the impact of an evolution and about the transition from one configuration to another.</p>

      <h2>Variability Engineering</h2>
      <p>The systematic modeling of variability in software systems has emerged as an effective approach to document and reason about software evolutions and heterogeneity. Variability modeling characterizes an “envelope” of possible software variations.</p>
