Interacto is a front-end framework for processing user interface events.

With Interacto developers handle user interactions (DnD, drag-lock, swipe, multi-touch, etc.) instead of low-level UI events. Developers configure how to turn a selected user interaction into a (undoable) UI command using a fluent API.
