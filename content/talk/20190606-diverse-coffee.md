abstract = "Inform 7 is a domain specific language to create interactive fiction and textual adventures. The language has been designed for writers and content creators rather than developers and it mimics natural English. It also comes with a full development environment that includes testing utils. In this DiverSE Coffee, we will explore the very basics of Inform 7 by creating a simple game. After Oscar talk, we will get to know from the ICSE'19 attendees their experience about being in such a huge premier software-engineering conference. Let's also talk about our movements for taking part in ICSE'20 in South Korea."
