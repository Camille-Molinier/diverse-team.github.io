title: "AI-generated art, have we missed something?"
abstract: >
  Deep Learning models has been the center of attention for quite a few years now;
  they have been made fun of for being so costly to train and yet being so poor at
  some tasks, they have caught attention as they seem to be able to do so many
  thing in a single architecture yet nobody knows how they work, more recently
  they have been feared for the potential of deep fake but also generative models
  such as Dall-E or midjourney.
  
  
  During the past 6 months, the US are facing a massive strike from artists,
  actors, etc.  as big names in the movie making business are thinking about using
  generative models to replace actors, voice actors, concept artists, etc.
  
  
  Once again, this is still software so... Have we missed an opportunity to
  prevent this?  Have we missed an opportunity to make new collaborations and
  apply our techniques to this new problem?
  
  
  This might be an idea that I could consider submitting to the "New and
  Controversial Ideas" track for VaMoS 2024
