  ### Florentin Royer, Preliminary study on the LLMs robustness by generating
  program variants


  After three (3) (0011) years of study, Florentin Royer confides exclusively
  about his internship subject, but also about a small (ü§è) piece of his
  life. We'll start with a brief look at his youth, the questionable life
  choices (ü§î) that led him to choose this path, and then get to the heart of
  the matter, namely LLM robustness assessment and the various methods
  associated with it.
