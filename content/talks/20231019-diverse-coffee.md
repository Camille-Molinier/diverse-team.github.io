title: "AmIUnique, a Browser fingerprinting platform"
abstract: >
  In this DiverSE coffee session, I’ll present an overview of my academic journey
  with a particular focus on the last two years. During this period, I’ve worked
  in Spirals team under the supervision of Pierre Laperdrix and Walter Rudametkin
  on maintaining a team project named [AmIUnique](https://amiunique.org/) which is a website that offers
  many features like creating browser fingerprints and computing its
  uniqueness. My main contribution in this project was designing and developing a
  new version with new features and modern UI. This version came after an in-depth
  analysis of the existing system, aimed at fixing issues, enhancing performance,
  introducing new features, and making collaboration within the project easy and
  smooth for team members. At the end of this presentation, I'll discuss my
  upcoming PhD research, starting in next January, which will focus on analyzing
  privacy within the Android OS ecosystem.
