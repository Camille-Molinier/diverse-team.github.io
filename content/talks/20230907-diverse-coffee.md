title: "Do you know your software project?"
abstract: >
  During this coffee I will present the metrics dashboard I've been working on
  during my contract. This web application aims to define an identity card of a
  software project, based on a set of application, development and DevOps
  metrics. More specifically, the application allows the user to compare their
  DevOps practices to those of similar software projects, in order to define the
  most adapted practices to reach a desired goal. These projects of reference are
  chosen from a large corpus of open-source projects.
