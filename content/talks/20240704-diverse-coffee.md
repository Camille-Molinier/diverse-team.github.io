title: "Enforcing specifications of data exchange systems"
abstract: >
  This talk overviews my main research line for my PhD thesis (which is slowly
  under construction) at the Complex Cyber Infrastructures group of the University
  of Amsterdam.


  The overall story is typical: we develop languages and tools for reasoning about
  and controlling distributed / multi-agent systems. The novelties arise in
  response to the characteristics of the systems. In this case, we target data
  exchange systems, which compute and communicate data across organisational
  boundaries. Thus, there is extra emphasis on (1) the specifications capturing
  legal and organisational regulations, and (2) the enforcement scheme maximising
  the autonomy of the organisations and their agents. I am most interested in
  approaches where agents cooperate by interleaving the development and
  enforcement of the shared specification at runtime.


  My goal is to make your acquaintance, receive feedback, and identify overlaps
  with your work.
