title: "Tech talk: Polyglot programming in the context of advanced web engineering"
abstract: >
  In this talk, I would like to show you an example of polyglot programming in
  the context of modern web engineering. The goal is to illustrate in practice
  how Rust is indeed a relevant language and a great technological stack for
  the implementation of a worker service and showing the ease to link these
  services with an application built with angular.


  I will start with a short overview of the main elements of a modern web
  browser by showing why it offers an attractive execution environment. I will
  remind the few SE principles at the core of Angular that support good
  development practices.


  I then propose to launch a discussion on the need to create generators for
  polyglot environments.


  I also propose to show the debugging capabilities currently offered in this
  context.


  I am sure Quentin will come with other demos to launch the discussion.
