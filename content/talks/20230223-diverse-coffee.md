title: WebAssembly Diversification for Malware Evasion
abstract: >
  WebAssembly is a binary format that has become an essential component of the
  web nowadays. Providing a faster alternative to JavaScript in the browser,
  this new technology has been embraced from its early days to create
  cryptomalware. This has triggered a solid effort to propose defenses that can
  detect WebAssembly malware. Yet, no defensive work has assumed that attackers
  would use evasion techniques. In this paper, we study how to evade
  WebAssembly cryptomalware detectors. We propose a novel evasion technique
  based on a state-of-the-art WebAssembly binary diversifier. We use the
  worldwide authoritative VirusTotal as malware detector to evaluate our
  technique. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to automatically
  generate variants of WebAssembly cryptomalware, which evade the considered
  strong detector. Remarkably, the variants introduce limited performance
  overhead. Our experiments also provide novel insights about which WebAssembly
  code transformations are the best suited for malware evasion. This provides
  insights for the community to improve the state of the art of WebAssembly
  malware detection.
