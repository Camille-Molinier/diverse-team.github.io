title: "What’s done and what’s next?"
abstract: >
  
  In my presentation, I will cover two main topics. First, I'll discuss the work from my internship on "Domain-specific exploration within orthogonal variability management," highlighting the key achievements from my 6-month internship with the team. The second part will focus on my PhD research, which centers on "Extending Infrastructure as Code (IaC) languages to enhance their capabilities for modern cloud deployment practices by leveraging operational data." I will provide further context on this work and outline our vision for the next steps.
