  * **A Pivot Language for Reasoning on DevSecOps Tools** (Yazid Benjamaa)
  
    State of the art in DevSecOps, results, and progress towards defining a DSL
    (Domain-Specific Language) for designing DevSecOps tools that can address
    specific issues and constraints causing a decline in security productivity.
   
  * **Static analysis of polyglot programs** (Bastien Sauvat)
  
    During this coffee, I will explain how static analysis is performed in Rust
    for polyglot programs.
    To illustrate this presentation, weâ€™ll take a look at my ongoing project :
    PolyglotAST, which is a Rust-based project designed to display the AST of a
    polyglot program.
    
  * **Web tool for configuration, execution and visualization of
    underground water runoff simulation** (Jeremy Bindel)
  
    During my intership, I developed a Jupyter Notebook to interact with a
    non-public Python library, HydroModPy. This library was about making
    simulation to predict underground water runoff. My role was to configure,
    execute and visualize results of the simulation in a Cloud oriented
    environment.
