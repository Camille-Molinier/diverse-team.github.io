title: "Leveraging MLIR for GPU-accelerated stencil computing"
abstract: >
  Weather and climate models extensively use stencil computations to model
  physical phenomena. These models have grown in complexity over the past decades
  and comprise large parts of todayâ€™s HPC workloads. With new architectures
  switching to heterogeneous compute nodes, climate models must be compiled and
  optimized for accelerator hardware. This presentation illustrates how a small
  team leveraged the MLIR infrastructure to compile stencil code for GPU
  accelerators. We demonstrate how we took advantage of the multi-level
  capabilities of MLIR by representing stencils in a high-level intermediate
  representation and subsequently lowering this representation down to GPU code.
  We show that the resulting toolchain outperforms the state-of-the-art when
  compiling the dynamical core of the European weather and climate model.
