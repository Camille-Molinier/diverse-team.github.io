title: Me, Myself and I
abstract: >
  This is the begining of a 54,687,134,513 suite of presentations of 2h each...
  ... ... ... (well, in fact only 2 slots of probably 20 minutes) Paul has
  passed his PhD in the team and has performed a post-doc in Namur for almost 4
  years. He felt that everybody forgot what he has done during his PhD and
  before and felt the need to talk about himself to gain self-confident and
  show how great his person was. In fact, he simply wants to be sure everybody
  gets an idea of his work because his background was first turn towards image
  processing and Machine Learning before getting into software variability,
  software testing, and more broadly software engineering thanks to his PhD.
  
  This presentation will be about past research he did during his PhD and
  post-doc mainly (a quick glimpse at his Master's thesis) before getting into
  research directions that he would like to explore in the future with DiverSE.
