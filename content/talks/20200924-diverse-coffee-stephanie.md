title: GCP MODEL, an inferred formal model-driven specification of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) # Do not include the name of the event or the speakers
abstract: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is one of the leaders among cloud APIs. It has gained notable expansion due to its suite of public cloud services that it based on a huge, solid infrastructure. GCP allows developers to use these services by accessing GCP RESTful API that is described through HTML pages on its website. However, the documentation of GCP API is written in natural language (English prose) and therefore shows several drawbacks, such as Informal Heterogeneous Documentation, Imprecise Types, Implicit Attribute Metadata, Hidden Links, Redundancy and Lack of Visual Support. To avoid confusion and misunderstandings, the cloud developers obviously need a precise specification of the knowledge and activities in GCP. Therefore, this paper introduces GCP MODEL, an inferred formal model-driven specification of GCP which describes without ambiguity the resources offered by GCP.
