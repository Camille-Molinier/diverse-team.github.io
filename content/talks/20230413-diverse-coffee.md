title: "The Universal Variability Language"
abstract: >
  The multitude of formats for specifying variability models induces additional
  effort for researchers and practitioners and hinders exchange. The Universal
  Variability Language (UVL) is a community effort towards a unified format.
  Over the last two years, several tools integrated UVL allowing a wide usage.
  In this Diverse Coffee, we will cover how UVL can be integrated as a language
  to analyze variability using the Python-based framework FLAMA. We will
  present how the framework has been designed having UVL in mind and how easy
  it is to integrate it with analysis support such as SAT, BDD, SMT, or other
  complementary tools that enable, for instance, transformations to other
  variability representations. Also we will show its architecture and how it
  links with DSL metamodeling approaches.
