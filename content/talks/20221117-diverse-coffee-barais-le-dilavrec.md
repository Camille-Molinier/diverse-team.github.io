title: A coffee with a mix of science, team life and technical stuff
abstract: >
  During this coffee, I will present 4 different elements. Yes, please plan 3
  hours of coffee ;) (a bit of science, a bit of team life, a bit of technical
  stuff).
  
  The first one will be a quick presentation of the SWHSec project (Leveraging
  Software Heritage to Enhance Cybersecurity (SWHSec)), we will do a longer
  presentation of this topic on a next coffee after the submission of a
  European SecBuild project led by Olivier Z. This first talk will be in a way
  a follow up of Lunar's talk last week.
  
  The second talk will be an introduction to the brainstorming of next week at
  the seminar. (For those who are not present, I'll send you an email recap of
  the work to do)
  
  The third one will be a quick update on the side project [CorrectExam](https://correctexam.github.io). As
  I introduced it to the team, I will make a small demo.
  
  The last one will be a demo by Quentin from [Build Custom Silicon with Google](https://developers.google.com/silicon) clearly inspiring.
