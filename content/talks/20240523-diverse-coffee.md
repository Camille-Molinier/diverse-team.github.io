title: "Back to the Future!"
abstract: >
  To celebrate the 10 years of the Diverse Coffee, let’s take a look in the
  rearview mirror and dive into the Diverse Research landscape 10 years ago. Once
  upon a time, there were many little PhD students in the team, like Paco, Inti,
  Ivan, Jacky, Thomas, Emmanuelle, Bosco, Nicolas, Guillaume, Marcelino, Juan,
  Sana, Suresh, David, Hamza, Simon, Aymeric, José, Erwan, Kwaku, Clément and
  Julien (as well as some lesser people too). If you don’t have a clue who they
  are, it means you're likely another naive millennial that doesn't know their
  history. I will dive a bit into the research by Paco, Inti, Ivan and Jacky, who
  I co-directed, and to show you that once upon a time I was a real researcher
  too! I hope there’s something interesting for everybody, but do I really care?
  Let’s find out this Thursday... ©[JB+WR]
