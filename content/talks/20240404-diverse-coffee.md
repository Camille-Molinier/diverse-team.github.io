  ### FairPipes: Data Mutation Pipelines for Machine Learning Fairness, Paul [(preprint)](https://hal.science/hal-04440201)
   Machine Learning (ML) models are ubiquitous in decision making applications
   impacting citizens' lives: credit attribution, crime recidivism, etc. In
   addition to seeking high performance and generalization abilities, insuring
   that ML models do not discriminate against citizens regarding their age,
   gender, or race is essential.  To this end, researchers developed various
   fairness assessment techniques, comprising fairness metrics and mitigation
   approaches, notably at the model level. However, the sensitivity of ML models
   to fairness data perturbations has been less explored. This paper presents
   mutation-based pipelines to emulate fairness variations in the data once the
   model is deployed. FairPipes propose a first set of mutation operators that
   can be further extended.  We evaluated FairPipes on seven ML models over three
   datasets. Our results highlight different fairness sensitivity behaviors
   across models, from the most sensitive perceptrons to the insensitive support
   vector machines.

  ### From Moldova to Inria in 5 Easy Steps, Sergiu [\[slides\]](/pdf/2024-04-04-Sergiu.pdf)
   My name is Sergiu MOCANU. I am a second year student at Istic’s Software
   Engineering Master. Last year I did an internship at Inria (team: LACODAM,
   mentor: Alexandre TERMIER) on the subjects of "Program Synthesis Using
   ChatGPT" – a rather short experience (that spanned over only 2 and a half
   months) that gave me a taste of what is research in the field of IT. As a
   natural continuation, for this year’s internship I chose the subject "Program
   Synthesis Using Open LLMs", having as supervisors Olivier BARAIS, Mathieu
   ACHER and Herman KOUADIO.  My interests in the field of programming lean more
   towards the abstract world (e.g., Logic & Calculability). Outside programming,
   my interests span over numerous and various subjects – ranging from ‘Music’
   and ‘Human Psychology’ to ‘Astronomy’ and ‘Quantum Physics’.
