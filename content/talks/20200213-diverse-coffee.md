title: Chiche project # Do not include the name of the event or the speakers
abstract: We will have the pleasure to welcome Sophie Barel and Benjamin Ninassi who will present the 'Chiche' project. The Chiche project is a national scientific mediation project in which Inria participates (operated by the Blaise Pascal foundation, with the support of the Ministry of Education and the SIF in particular). The idea is to give a taste of digital science to students in the first year of secondary school and to prepare them for the new discipline SNT (Digital Sciences and Technology), by bringing scientists, engineers, doctoral students ... into schools to tell them about their career paths and their work / research.
