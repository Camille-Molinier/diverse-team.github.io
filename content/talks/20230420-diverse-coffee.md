title: "SLR on Language Workbenches"
abstract: >
  This talk focuses on the collaboration between Theo and Jérôme. The talk
  begins with an introduction to Jérôme who is a phd candidate at the Institute
  for Control Engineering of Machine Tools and Manufacturing Units (ISW) of the
  University of Stuttgart. His introduction will include his research,
  projects, teaching, and life at the ISW. The collaboration topics discussed
  include a systematic literature review on language workbenches, ten years
  after [Erdweg et al.'s paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02654-1_11), based on language workbench challenges. The
  talk provides details on the methodology used for the review, including the
  search query and interesting findings, as well as the research questions that
  emerge from the study. The discussion then then moves on to language
  composition, which presents common operators, aggregation, and embedding, and
  proposes next steps to extract parameters in more detail and apply them to
  graphical languages. Finally, the talk concludes with a roadmap for future
  collaborations between the two researches of Rennes and Stuttgart.
