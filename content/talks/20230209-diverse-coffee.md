title: "A Call for Removing Variability"
abstract: >
   Software variability is largely accepted and explored in software engineering
   and seems to have become a norm and a must, if only in the context of product
   lines. Yet, the removal of superfluous or unneeded software artefacts and
   functionalities is an inevitable trend. It is frequently investigated in
   relation to software bloat. This paper is essentially a call to the community
   on software variability to devise methods and tools that will facilitate the
   removal of unneeded variability from software systems. The advantages are
   expected to be numerous in terms of functional and non-functional properties,
   such as maintainability (lower complexity), security (smaller attack
   surface), reliability, and performance (smaller binaries).
