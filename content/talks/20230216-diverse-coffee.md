title: "HyperAST Bis"
abstract: >
  The goal of this Diverse Coffee is to give an update to the team on the state
  of HyperAST.


  Starting with the motivations behind the making of the HyperAST ([on mining
   coevolutions, ICSME'21](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9609128)).
  Then I will present what is currently available in the HyperAST ([ASE'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3551349.3560423),
  FSE submission), along with the state of other related projects ([stack-graph](https://github.com/github/stack-graphs),
  [semantic](https://github.com/github/semantic), [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-graph), [diffract](https://github.com/softdevteam/diffract), common data structures and
  patterns in Rust).


  Finally, I will present some teaching resources and feedbacks, one on the
  book "[Hands-On Rust](https://hands-on-rust.com)" (Bac+2), and another one on "[Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)" (Bac+4).
