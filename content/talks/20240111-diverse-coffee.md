title: "My professional journey"
abstract: >
  As a new PhD student of the DiverSE team, I will first introduce myself and
  my previous experience. I’ve done a large part of my studies as an
  apprentice (i.e. 50% at school, 50% in a company) with Orange Innovation,
  and worked on many topics that I’ll describe shortly. For the second part of
  the presentation, I’ll present my PhD topic which focuses on privacy bug in
  web applications and I will show a first categorization of web tracking
  techniques.
