title: "Q&A Session on Free Software"
abstract: >
  Over the past 20 years, open source became prevalent in software development,
  at least for anything related to tooling or libraries. What does “open
  source” really mean? Is it different form “free software”? How does it work?
  How can I improve the tools I use on a daily basis? What does it means to be
  a maintainer? Why is no one contributing to my project? Will open source save
  the world?


  These are examples of question you could ask Lunar during this DiverSE
  Coffee. They–and anyone in the room–will happily share their experience in
  participating to free/libre open source software projects.
event: DiverSE Coffee
location: Rennes, France
