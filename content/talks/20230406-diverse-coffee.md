title: "Langium + Sirius Web = ❤️"
abstract: >
  [Langium](https://langium.org/) is an open-source project which proposes an alternative to [Xtext](https://eclipse.dev/Xtext/) in
  the NodeJS platform. Developed around [LSP (Language Server Protocol)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), Langium
  is therefore totally front-end technology agnostic as long as the front-end
  supports the protocol. The goal of this talk is to show how we went from no
  knowledge of Langium to a prototype integrated in the [Eclipse Sirius Web](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html)
  infrastructure and applied to a subset of SysML v2. SysML v2 being the newest
  version still under specification of SysML, a textual and graphical modeling
  language for system engineering. Thus, Sirius Web wich already proposes a
  graphical edition can offer users a textual edition of the model thanks to
  Langium.


  What were the difficulties encountered using this emerging technology and to
  its integration in a large architecture such as Sirius Web? How did we
  overcome them? What challenges remain in order to move from the prototype to
  something that can be industrialized? We propose to answer these questions
  through our own experience.
