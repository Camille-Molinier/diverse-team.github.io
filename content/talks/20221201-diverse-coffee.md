title: Return-oriented programming (ROP)
abstract: >
  Modern security exploits are based on code-reuse techniques. Code-reuse
  techniques allow to bypass non-executable memory constraints (NX bit) that
  prevent attackers to inject and execute malicious code into a program's data
  sections. One of the first and most popular code-reuse attack is Return
  Oriented Programming (ROP).


  How does it work? How does one mitigates ROP attacks? Is it still exploitable
  nowadays? In this presentation we will do a quick review of what led to the
  invention of code-reuse attacks and how ROP works. Then, we will give an
  overview of some existing countermeasures, their efficiency and see whether
  ROP is still relevant nowadays.
