title: "Domain Specific Modeling for Early Design Evaluation"
abstract: >
  In this talk, I'll present the context and results of work done for the DGA
  with regard to modeling support for the evaluation of early designs of
  security products. The aim of this work is to develop a domain specific
  "modeling framework" based on multi-views models for which the completeness
  and correctness of those views is very important.
