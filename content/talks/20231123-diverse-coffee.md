title: "xDSL: A Compiler Infrastructure for DSLs"
abstract: >
  DSLs introduce domain-specific high level structure to programs, allowing easier
  development and modeling of complex problems to programmers. But this structure
  also brings in more opportunities for optimization and transformation of
  programs, for which a domain-specific compiler is necessary. We present xDSL, an
  accessible infrastructure to design compilers for domain-specific
  languages. xDSL operates by modeling programs at a high level level of
  abstraction, directly out of DSL frontends, to lower abstraction step by step
  within the same program.
