  Hello, my name is Charly, and I’m a PhD student in the DiverSE team. In this presentation, I’ll begin by introducing myself, sharing a bit about my academic background and the internships I’ve completed. Next, I’ll talk about the work I carried out during my year as a research engineer in the team. I’ll then present my PhD project, including the context, my progress so far, and the goals I’m working towards. Finally, I’ll briefly share a few of my activities and interests outside of work.
