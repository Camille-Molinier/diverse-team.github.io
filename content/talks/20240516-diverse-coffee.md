title: "CNNGen: A Generator and a Dataset for Energy-Aware Neural Architecture Search"
abstract: >
  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods seek optimal networks by exploring
  thousands of variants of a reference architecture. Yet, optimality is
  typically related to prediction performance, overlooking the environmental
  impacts of training. Thus, NAS search spaces are unfit for performance and
  energy consumption trade-offs. We contribute to energy-aware NAS with (i) a
  grammar-based Convolutional Neural Network generator (CNNGen) producing
  diverse architectures not based on a reference one; (ii) 1,300 available
  architectures obtained via CNNGen with their implementation, energy
  consumption and performance measurements; (iii) Three state-of-the-art
  predictors releasing the need for trained models for performance and energy
  estimation.
