title: "My PhD and more about me - Domain Specific Language Specialization"
abstract: >
  As a new DiverSE team member I will start by introducing myself through my
  professional experiments, so my internships. I will provide a special focus on
  my only research internship.
  
  
  Then I will present an insight into my PhD subject "Domain specific Language
  Specialization" by explaining with a use case the motivations and our idea for a
  potential solution.
