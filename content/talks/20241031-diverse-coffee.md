title: "ParaPLUIE: ParaPhrase, Llm Used for Improved Evaluation"
abstract: >
  
  Evaluating automatic paraphrase production systems is a difficult task because it involves, among other things, assessing the semantic proximity between two sentences. Usual measures are based on lexical distances, or at least on semantic embedding alignments. In this article we study some of these measures on datasets of paraphrases and non-paraphrases known for their quality or difficulty on this task. We propose a new measure, ParaPLUIE, based on the use of a large language model. According to our experiments, this one is better to sort pairs of sentences by semantic proximity.
