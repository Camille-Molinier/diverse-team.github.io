title: "ChatGPT and End-user Programming"
abstract: >
  Is it possible to program non-trivial applications and customize code without
  knowing much about programming?
  Impressive showcases of ChatGPT suggest a positive answer, while some have
  claimed that programmers will be replaced or disappear.
  
  
  In this coffee sponsored by INSA Rennes, we will present two lines of work
  that explore the actual link between ChatGPT and end-user programming.
  Margaux (Millour) will first introduce herself, for her last day at DiverSE.
  She will describe how she generated variants of Flappy bird games out of the
  same or different prompts.
  She will detail different methods and strategies to interact with ChatGPT3.5
  and 4.
  She will also synthesize her findings and provides insights about the two
  first sentences of the abstract.
  
  
  Joint work with Paul (Temple), not at INSA Rennes.  Mathieu (Acher) will
  briefly demonstrate how ChatGPT can aid end-users in customizing complex
  programming code such as TikZ, SVG, CSS, or SCAD, by transforming it into a
  user-friendly, configurable version through a web-based tool.
