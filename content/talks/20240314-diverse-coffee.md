title: "Reflections on 'How Will We Develop Over the Next 5 to 10 Years?': A Decade Later and Beyond"
abstract: >
  About 10 years ago (2012 actually), I wrote a small vision article for the
  general purpose magazine Programmez![1] "Comment allons-nous dÃ©velopper dâ€™ici 5
  Ã  10 ans ?"[2]
  I'll present the ideas (mainly inspired from the team's research subjects at
  that time ðŸ˜‰) in order to discuss with you if these forecasts have been
  reached. Then, I'll present a more recent vision and how it may unify several of
  our team activities.
