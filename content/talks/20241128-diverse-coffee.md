title: Let me introduce myself..
abstract: >
  I recently joined the DiverSE team as a research engineer. Through this presentation, I would like to give you an idea of who I am and what I did in the past. In the first part of the presentation, I will trace back my professional life from my first experiences as an intern software engineer to my integration in the DiverSE team. Next, I will introduce you to the project I will be part of during my stay in the DiverSE team: CodeCommons. I will present an overview of the project and the role I will take in it. Finally, for you to know me better, I will conclude with a more personal introduction, where I will briefly tell you what I enjoy doing outside work.
