title: "Ground Toolchain: a modern toolchain for digital logic circuits"

  This first presentation will focus on two sub-projects under development:
  ground-sim, a digital logic circuit simulator, and ground-design, a GUI

  We'll showcase the progress made so far, and talk about our long-term
  ambitions for the Ground project as a whole.
