title: "TUXAI: Machine learning within the Linux kernel configuration space"
abstract: >
  Configuring a Linux kernel involves a multitude of options, numbering over
  20,000. Prior to the TUXAI project, hundreds of thousands of Linux kernel
  configurations were compiled across different versions spanning a three-year
  period, resulting in a unique dataset. The primary objective of TUXAI is to
  predict the kernel size and the impact of each option based on various
  parameters using machine learning techniques. This presentation provides an
  overview of the work done since the beginning of the project, with a focus on
  technical decisions and addressing raised questions.
