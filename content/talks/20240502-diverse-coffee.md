title: "Correct Exam: Modern Software Architecture in Practice"
abstract: >
  [CorrectExam](https://correctexam.github.io/) is a tool to help with the correction of paper copies. Its
  primary aim is to enable students to receive quickly, more detailed feedback on
  their work, and teachers to see detailed analyses of assignments and
  questions. Itâ€™s a simple way of saving work in digital form, preserving the
  original work and enabling quick and easy viewing from anywhere.

  In this talk, Olivier will give us a brief update on the progress of the
  project.
