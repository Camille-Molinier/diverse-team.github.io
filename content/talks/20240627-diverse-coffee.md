  ### Development of a Web SCADA interface for the control of a Fischertechnik-based factory, by Thierry Traore

  In modern industry, user interfaces play a crucial role in the management of
  complex supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This project
  focuses on the design of a web interface using Angular and Spring Boot for a
  Fischertechnik-based plant, aiming to optimize the management and control of
  industrial processes through its digital twin.


  We will explore the technical challenges encountered during the development of
  the interface, including the integration of advanced functionalities such as
  near real-time visualization of production data, remote control of equipment and
  alert management. We will also present the strategies adopted to ensure the
  architecture's scalability.


  In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of using Angular and
  Spring Boot together to create a modern, reactive and high-performance user
  interface for a Fischertechnik plant. It illustrates how these technologies can
  significantly improve the productivity and reliability of industrial operations
  through an optimized interface.


  ### Optimizing Weather and Water Data Management: Integration, Automated Cleaning, and Dashboard Visualization, by Aubry Tonnerre

  During my internship at IRISA, I will present my academic background and
  describe the work I am undertaking this summer as part of the DiverSE team.


  Due to developments in tree production in Laos, the country's geography has
  undergone significant changes. In response to these changes, a research team
  established a watershed in the Houay Pano region of Laos 20 years ago. This
  watershed is utilized to measure water flow based on rainfall and the water
  level. However, the data collected is occasionally erroneous, complicating its
  usability. Consequently, human intervention is required to correct these
  discrepancies. The objective of my project is to design a system to automate the
  data cleaning process and develop an IoT architecture using LORA technologies to
  enhance the existing system.
