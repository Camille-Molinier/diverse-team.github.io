  ### A Tale of Synthesis, Théo [\[slides\]](/pdf/2024-03-28-TheoMatricon.pdf)
   I will briefly give an overview of the research questions I tackled during my
   PhD and provide rough sketches of how to answer a few of them. I will mainly be
   talking about program synthesis from executable tests and its challenges, then I
   will shortly talk about comparing performance of two algorithms/variants.

  ### Haitam [\[slides\]](/pdf/2024-03-28-Haitam.pdf)
   I'm EL HAYANI Haitam, a senior software engineering student at the National
   School of Computer Science and System Analysis (ENSIAS) in Morocco.
   My end of studies internship within the DiverSe team is: Domain-specific
   exploration within orthogonal model-based variability management, under the
   mentorship of Prof. Benoit Combemale and Dr. Steffen Zschaler.
   I’m more interested on topics related to DevOps, Cloud native applications,
   microservices and Backend development.
   My background on mathematics was the main reason why I chose computer science,
   since they share one common advantage, which is the power of abstraction.
