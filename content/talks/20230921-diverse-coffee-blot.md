title: Genetic Improvement and Magpie
abstract: >
Genetic Improvement (GI) is an innovative approach that's transforming how we
enhance and optimise software.  Imagine treating your code like living
organisms, allowing it to evolve and improve automatically.  GI leverages
principles from genetics and evolution to fine-tune software, making it more
efficient, reliable, and adaptable.  It's an exciting field at the intersection
of software engineering and artificial intelligence, promising to reshape how we
create and maintain software systems.

Magpie is a tool that brings the principles of GI to life by automating software
improvement.  It's a versatile and powerful ally for software engineers,
offering a unified framework to enhance both the functional and non-functional
aspects of software.  It's like having a geneticist for your codebase, exploring
ways to enhance it by tweaking parameters, performing program transformations,
and optimising compilers.  Available now! https://github.com/bloa/magpie
