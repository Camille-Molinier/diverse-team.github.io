title: Future Research Directions
abstract: >
  As announced, the next coffee will be the last of Paul's 54Billions bundle
  presentation (how time flies!).


  He will talk about the research directions he envisions developing in
  DiverSE.


  Mainly, it will be about machine learning, software testing (wow! Big
  news...), and a bit of energy efficiency (not trendy at all...). The first
  research direction will be about bridging ML and SE, the second will be about
  Antoine Gratia's Ph.D. and using Software Variability to reason about Deep
  Learning models. The last direction is about considering the ML component in
  modern systems and especially the problem of performing evolution in a DevOps
  context of this component.
