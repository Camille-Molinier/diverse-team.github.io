title: "Towards Testing Polyglot Programs"
abstract: >
  Today, a plethora of programming languages exists, each better suited for a
  particular concern. For example, Python is suited for data analysis but not
  web development, whereas JavaScript is the inverse. As software complexity
  grows and needs to address multiple concerns, different programming languages
  are often used in combination, despite the burden of bridging them.


  Polyglot programming emerged as a solution allowing the seamless mixing of
  multiple programming languages. GraalVM and PolyNote are examples of runtimes
  allowing polyglot programming. However, there is a striking lack of support
  for many development tooling for polyglot programs; in particular, the many
  techniques used to automate the generation of tests (or even write tests at
  all) remain unexplored in a polyglot setting.


  This talk will thus aim to present the goal of the internship, centered
  around the topic of polyglot testing, by introducing the concepts present in
  polyglot programs, the state of the art of automated test generation as well
  as some preliminary findings.
